<h1>Skills</h1>
</div>  
  
<p>Skills are typically associated with what we do, but also define who we are. Read on to figure out why I may be a good hire, or better, a cool guy to hang out with. </p>
 
  <h3>tony stark in the <span>mind</span></h3>  
  
  <p>Even though I have yet to create my iron man, I have spent some time enriching my interpersonal skills and understanding of various business logics with a some specific technical capabilities.</p> 
  <p>In fact, I did not study languages during my time at university but Iâ€™ve become good at translating complex business messages into simpler ones as well as as translating <span>abstract</span> workflows into <span>tangible</span> processes, especially leveraging the use of technology. I can code my own website using <span>html</span> and <span>css</span> and I can run social media analyses via Twitter's Search API using <span>python</span>. There is more too, but see my cv for that.</p>
  <p>Before we move to the next section, also note that I developed my own <span>ethereum-based</span> hospitality resale platform with two friends. You cannot google it, but trust me it's there (see projects...).</p>
  
<h3>jack sparrow in the <span>heart</span></h3>   
  
  <p>okay, maybe not as charming as jack and definitely more reliable and open-minded than him, but surely up for new adventures all the time. </p> 
  <p>this is what I will always stress matters most - no skill or magic will ever be able to compete with the value of reliability, punctuality and respect. I am results-oriented, but journey-driven. I let passion <span>fuel</span> me, love <span>elevate</span> me and dreams <span>guide</span> me.</p>
  <p>I have received a lot by being curious and having friends who were willing to open to me and share their inner secrets. Now, I try to return the favor by, well, <span>simply conversing</span> (hint, that's my podcast) and <span>semplicemente parlando</span> (hint, that's my other, older podcast).</p>
