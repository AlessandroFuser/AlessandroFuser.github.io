Code to insert in 

<h3>where it all began</h3>

<p>
I was born in <span>Desenzano</span>, right next to the biggest blue dot on Italy’s map. Romeo and Juliet grew up and….well you know how the story ends…nearby. I grew up close to Venice, though, in <span>Treviso</span> and while my passport is burgundy, I am not your typical Italian. I attended english schools since I was the size of Ikea's kvistbro table and never even got close to a soccer ball.  Speaking of balls, I started playing golf and tennis young because - "Son, business is all about golf. Learn it now, thank me later" (insert voice of 7 foot handsome dad). I succeeded in wrapping up high school a year early and hopped on a plane to <span>Malibu</span>, CA, exactly 6,138 miles away. 
</p>

<h3>where I got tanned and motivated</h3>
  
<p>
I started Pepperdine young, ambitious and without a beard. By the time I wrapped up my bachelor I was still young and ambitious, but some extra facial hair did come through. A lot happened in four years in the <span>United States</span>. I became president of the university’s entrepreneur club, led a professional fraternity as well as joined and had fun in a social fraternity. I also got my first internships and then another five, but we will talk about that later. I also went on an exchange program at Fudan in <span>Shanghai
</span>, obtained a certificate in conflict management from Caruso’s School of Law and graduated cum laude. Sprinkle some celebrities, sunlife organics açaí bowls and lots of sun and that sums up my undergraduate career.
</p>

<h3>where I became an adult</h3>
  
<p>
I got ready to return to Europe, but fulfilled my dream of living in the US (and I promise there will be a second chapter). Back in <span>Milan</span> I got my masters from Bocconi University, found love and took the great relationships with my dad even higher. I became a consultant, started working in <span>London<span> and learned all sorts of things about blockchain, podcasting and technology. Fast forward to the present, I have now become more aware of what really matters in life and am in the processing of designing a pretty phenomenal continuation to an outstanding 24 years on this planet.
