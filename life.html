<p>And now the really important stuff. My journey so far. </p>  
  
<div class="heading"><h3>Italy</h3></div>

<div class="cities"><h3><strong>Desenzano, Treviso, Padua & Milan</strong></span></a> [JUNE 1995 â€“ 2019]</h3></div>

<div class="bulletpoints">
    <p><ul>
      <li>I was born in Desenzano del Garda (Romeo and Juliet grew up nearby which makes me a romantic), but grew up in Treviso, city of art and culture (that's what the guides say).</li>
      <li>I am not your typical Italian. I attended english schools since I was the size of Ikea's Kvistbro table and never even got close to a soccer ball.</li>
      <li>Speaking of balls, I started playing golf and tennis young because - "Son, business is all about golf. Learn it now, thank me later" (insert voice of 7 foot handsome dad).</li>
      <li>On a more serious note, I lost my mom as a kid. Worst thing that can ever happens to anyone. I found my best friend as a consequence though: my dad.</li>
      <li>Got done with high school a year early and moved 6,138miles away. Eventually returned to get a masters from Bocconi University</li>
    </ul></p>
 </div>
  
<div class="heading"><h3>Unites States</h3></div>

<div class="cities"><h3><strong>Los Angeles & Malibu</strong></span></a> [AUG 2013 - 2017]</h3></div>

<div class="bulletpoints">
   <p><ul>
      <li>Where do I even begin. Sun, beach, Sunlife Organics, Erewhon, DSP, SigEp. Also, entrepreneur club, 6 internships, new best friends, celebrities, first car, first cards.</li>
      <li>I got into Pepperdine University (and a few schools on the East Coast, but Malibu...). Loved every bit of it. Graduated cum laude, attended Fudan University in Shanghai for a semester, and spent time at Pepp's Caruso School of Law.</li>
      <li>Became a kick ass leader (I need to believe so don't be a party pooper), got into working out, swimming in the ocean at sunrise and become a master networker.</li>
      <li>Got ready to return to Europe, but fulfilled my dream of living in the US. In the words of Arnold, I will be back and not just temporarily.</li>
   </ul></p>
 </div>

<div class="heading"><h3>United Kingdom</h3></div>

<div class="cities"><h3><strong>London & Airplanes, Lots of them</strong></span></a> [AUG 2019 - Present]</h3></div>

<div class="bulletpoints">
    <p><ul>
      <li>Graduated with a masters from Bocconi and started working in the City (look up, I'm on the top of Tower 42). I am a consultant on the outside, but a techie inside.</li>
      <li>I started a new flight routine where I take lots of flights. It's for love though so it's fine. I also got into coding (see this website for example), podcasting (more on that somewhere) and, well, lots of other stuff.</li>
      <li>I became more aware of what really matters in life and am in the processing of designing a pretty phenomenal continuation to an outstanding 24 years on this planet.</li>
      <li>To be continued.</li>
    </ul></p>
